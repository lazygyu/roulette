# Build Check Rule

- After the work, it is essential to check the success of the build.
- Use `yarn build` command to build the project.
  - Ensure that the build process completes without errors.
  - If the build fails, check the error messages and fix the issues before proceeding.
  - The build command should be run in the root directory of the project.
